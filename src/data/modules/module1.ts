# Choosing a Business Idea

## Key Questions to Ask Yourself

**What problem does your business solve?**
Every successful business solves a problem or fulfills a need. Before starting, identify what problem your business will address.

**Who is your target market?**
Understanding your customers is critical. Consider:
- Demographics (age, location, income level)
- Needs and pain points
- Buying behavior

**What is your unique selling point (USP)?**
What makes your business different from competitors? This could be:
- Better pricing
- Superior quality
- Unique service approach
- Faster delivery
- Personal touch

## Steps to Identify Your Business Idea

1. **Identify your skills and passions** - What are you good at? What do you enjoy?
2. **Evaluate market needs** - What problems do people in your community face?
3. **Consider profitability** - Can you make money from this idea?
4. **Assess sustainability** - Can this business grow over time?
5. **Calculate startup costs** - How much money do you need to start?
6. **Analyze competition** - Who else is doing this? How can you do it better?

# Market Research and Feasibility

## Why Market Research Matters

Market research helps you:
- Understand customer demand
- Identify competitors
- Set realistic pricing
- Avoid costly mistakes
- Make informed decisions

## How to Conduct Simple Market Research

### 1. Online Research
- Google searches about similar businesses
- Social media groups and discussions
- Industry reports and articles

### 2. Surveys and Interviews
- Talk to potential customers
- Ask about their needs and preferences
- Find out what they currently use

### 3. Competitor Analysis
Create a competitor analysis table:

| Competitor | Products/Services | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------------|---------|-----------|------------|
| Business A | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Business B | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 4. SWOT Analysis

**Strengths** - What advantages does your business have?
**Weaknesses** - What limitations do you face?
**Opportunities** - What market opportunities can you exploit?
**Threats** - What external challenges might you face?

## Feasibility Assessment

Ask yourself:
- Is there enough demand for my product/service?
- Can I compete with existing businesses?
- Do I have the resources to start?
- Can I make a profit?

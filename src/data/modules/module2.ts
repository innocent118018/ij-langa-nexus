# Choosing and Reserving a Business Name

## Why Your Business Name Matters

Your business name:
- Creates first impressions
- Builds brand identity
- Affects marketing and visibility
- Must be legally available

## Rules for Business Names in South Africa

### Prohibited Elements:
❌ Cannot include "Bank," "Insurance," "University" without authorization
❌ Cannot be identical to existing registered names
❌ Cannot be offensive or misleading
❌ Cannot imply government affiliation

### Requirements:
✅ Must be unique (check CIPC database)
✅ Must add "(Pty) Ltd" for private companies
✅ Must add "NPC" for non-profit companies
✅ Can include descriptive words

## How to Check Name Availability

**Step 1:** Go to CIPC eServices (https://eservices.cipc.co.za)
**Step 2:** Click "Company Name Search"
**Step 3:** Enter your proposed name
**Step 4:** Check if any similar names exist

**Example:**
- ❌ "ABC Trading" (if ABC Trading Pty Ltd already exists)
- ✅ "ABC Trading Solutions (Pty) Ltd" (unique variation)

## Name Reservation Process

1. **Search for availability** on CIPC portal
2. **Reserve the name** (valid for 60 days)
3. **Pay reservation fee** (approximately R50)
4. **Receive confirmation** with reservation number
5. **Complete registration** within 60 days

**Important:** Name reservation does not equal company registration!

## Naming Best Practices

### DO:
✅ Keep it simple and memorable
✅ Make it relevant to your business
✅ Check domain name availability (.co.za)
✅ Consider future growth (don't be too specific)

### DON'T:
❌ Use hard-to-spell words
❌ Copy competitors closely
❌ Include geographic limits (unless intentional)
❌ Use numbers or symbols unnecessarily

## Defensive Name Registration

Consider registering variations to protect your brand:
- Main business name
- Common misspellings
- .com and .co.za domains
- Social media handles

## Name Change Later

You CAN change your business name later, but:
- Requires amendment process
- Costs money and time
- May confuse customers
- Loses brand recognition

**Better to get it right the first time!**

1. CIPC first (everything depends on this)
2. Then banking (need registration number)
3. Then SARS (need bank details)
4. Then other registrations (can run parallel)

**Risks/Delays:**
- CIPC rejection if documents incomplete (+1-2 weeks)
- Bank account delays (+1 week)
- VAT registration verification (+2-3 weeks)

**Quick Wins:**
- Use home address (avoid commercial lease delays)
- DIY registration (save R2,000+ in fees)
- Start SARS eFiling registration while waiting for CIPC
